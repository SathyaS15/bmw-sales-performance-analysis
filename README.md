# 🚗 BMW Sales Data Analysis (Python Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes BMW sales data to identify key sales trends, revenue drivers, and customer demand patterns.  
The analysis focuses on understanding model performance, pricing impact, regional distribution, and time-based sales trends.

The goal is to extract business insights that can support strategic decision-making in the luxury automobile market.


## 🎯 Business Objective
- Identify top-performing BMW models  
- Analyze revenue contribution by model  
- Study price vs sales volume relationship  
- Understand regional sales distribution  
- Evaluate time-based sales trends  



## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  



## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Model-wise total sales and revenue analysis  
- Price vs quantity sold comparison  
- Regional sales performance analysis  
- Monthly/Yearly sales trend analysis
